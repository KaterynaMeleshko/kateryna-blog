## Work progress
### Tasks
in these two weeks i planned to finish the hardware module

### Details 
the goal was to finish the hardware module, but i’m still working on it. even so, i’ve already learned a lot of new things. during this project i broke down the computer into all its main layers: the cpu with its silicon crystal, the power system, the gpu with its vram, and both volatile and non-volatile memory. i looked not only at how each part functions, but also at the physical base like how transistors in doped silicon switch currents, how capacitors store and leak charge, how magnetic domains on platters flip north or south, and how electrons get trapped in floating-gate flash cells. i also studied the hardware and software interfaces, and the role of peripheral devices. in the end, i can say i built a complete picture of the pc and how does it function as a system

### Reflexion
overall, i’ve made progress in my knowledge, however my time management is still not great. by the end of this week i wanted to be done with the module, but i still have a few slides left to go through, and i also need to prepare the presentation, though i already have some ideas for that. i can see where i’m failing, i get stuck on details too much. when i learn something, i don’t consider it understood until i’ve broken it down to a molecular level, but that level of depth isn’t always necessary to grasp the main concepts. this is something i need to change. to improve, i’ll try to set clear goals and, within the modules, stick more closely to the presentation slides

### Goals for the next weeks
- finish the hardware module: wed
- make the presentation & present it: thu/fri
- everything git-related: next wed/thu
- everything offer-related: next thu/fri
