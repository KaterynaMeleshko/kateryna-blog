## Part 1 - Hardware components
---

#### CPU  
The CPU is the part of the computer that executes program instructions. It performs calculations, logical operations, and controls the flow of data.  
- Modern CPUs have multiple cores, which allow them to work on several tasks at the same time.  
- Without the CPU, software cannot run.  

#### Motherboard 
The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all hardware parts.  
- Components like the CPU, RAM, storage devices, GPU, and PSU are either installed directly on it or connected through it.  
- Modern motherboards often include built-in functions such as network connection, sound, and sometimes basic graphics output.  

#### RAM 
RAM is the short-term memory of the computer.  
- It stores data and program instructions that the CPU needs immediately.  
- RAM is much faster than storage, but it is volatile: all data is lost once the computer is powered off.  

#### Storage Device  
Storage devices keep data permanently, even when the computer is turned off.  
- HDD (Hard Disk Drive): uses spinning disks, cheaper and with large capacity but slower.  
- SSD (Solid State Drive): uses flash memory, much faster and more reliable than HDDs.  
- Storage is where the operating system, applications, and personal files are saved.  

#### PSU  
The PSU takes electricity from the wall and converts it into the lower voltages required by the components.  
- It powers the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage, and other devices.  
- A stable PSU is essential for the reliability of the entire system.  

#### GPU  
The GPU is specialized for rendering images, videos, and animations.  
- It is highly efficient in parallel calculations, which makes it faster than the CPU for graphics tasks.  
- Some CPUs have integrated graphics, but dedicated GPUs are used for gaming, design, and other demanding applications.  

#### Cooling  
All electronic parts generate heat while working. Cooling systems remove this heat to keep the components safe.  
- Air cooling: uses fans and heatsinks, the most common method.  
- Water cooling: uses liquid to transport heat away, more efficient for high-performance systems.  
- Without proper cooling, the system could overheat and malfunction.
